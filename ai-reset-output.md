### How AI Is Impacting Jobs Like Yours

AI is automating repetitive tasks in ERP, support, and operations roles, such as system configuration, data entry, and routine troubleshooting, while creating opportunities for hybrid roles that leverage your experience. Here’s a fact-based breakdown:

- **Automation of Routine Tasks**: McKinsey’s 2023 report projects that 29.5% of hours worked in U.S. office support roles (e.g., ERP support, technical coordination) could be automated by 2030 due to generative AI. For example, AI tools like robotic process automation (RPA) handle tasks like ticket resolution or system updates, reducing manual work.[](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-upskilling)
- **Demand for Hybrid Roles**: The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report estimates 11 million new AI-related jobs globally by 2030, including roles like AI integration specialists and technical program managers, which build on your system knowledge and coordination skills.[](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/unlocking-human-potential-building-a-responsible-ai-ready-workforce-for-the-future/)
- **Value of Non-Technical Skills**: The Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) 2024 report notes that 58% of in-demand skills for growing occupations are non-technical, such as process mapping, stakeholder communication, and problem-solving—skills you’ve honed in your career.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/)

**What This Means for You**: Your role isn’t vanishing—it’s evolving. Companies need professionals who can manage AI-enhanced ERP systems (e.g., SAP with AI analytics) or coordinate projects involving AI tools. Your experience in troubleshooting, understanding workflows, and working with stakeholders positions you for roles like ERP Consultant or Technical Program Manager (TPM).
