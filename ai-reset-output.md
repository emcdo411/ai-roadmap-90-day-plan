## 🧭 Overview

This repo is designed as a **live coaching tool** to guide professionals — especially those with experience in ERP, operations, or systems support — into AI-enhanced roles without hype, fear, or jargon.

You don’t need to learn to code to stay relevant. But you *do* need a plan — and that’s what this repo offers.

The full coaching response is embedded below, backed by **verifiable statistics**, **WIOA eligibility links**, and **free training** via Google, Microsoft, and LinkedIn Learning. I built this repo to walk people I care about through the basics, with empathy and realism.

## 📉 What's at Stake

If you’ve been in tech-adjacent support roles — ERP, helpdesk, technical PM, or backend coordination — you might already feel the shift:

* Roles are disappearing or becoming AI-augmented
* You’re expected to know prompt engineering, agile, or cloud tools overnight
* People keep saying "just learn AI" — but no one’s explaining how or *why* it applies to you

This repo changes that. It’s not about learning everything. It’s about learning just enough — with clarity.
