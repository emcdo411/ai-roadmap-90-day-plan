## 🔍 How AI is Reshaping Support Roles

* **29.5%** of U.S. office support hours can be automated by 2030 (McKinsey, 2023)
* **11M+ new jobs** will be created in AI-adjacent fields (WEF, 2025)
* **58%** of in-demand skills are non-technical (CSET, 2024)

Roles in ERP, ticketing systems, and backend coordination are being enhanced or replaced with automation tools. Your experience is still valuable, but you must adapt to hybrid roles — like AI-enhanced ERP Consultant or Technical Program Manager.

ERP support, coordination, and stakeholder experience transfer directly into:
