### How AI Is Impacting Jobs Like Yours

AI is automating repetitive tasks in ERP, support, and operations roles, such as system configuration, data entry, and routine troubleshooting, while creating opportunities for hybrid roles that leverage your experience. Here’s a fact-based breakdown:

* **Automation of Routine Tasks**: McKinsey’s 2023 report projects that 29.5% of hours worked in U.S. office support roles could be automated by 2030 due to generative AI. For example, robotic process automation (RPA) tools are increasingly handling ticket resolution and system updates.
* **Demand for Hybrid Roles**: The World Economic Forum projects 11 million new AI-related jobs by 2030, including roles like AI integration specialists and technical program managers — roles that value your background.
* **Value of Non-Technical Skills**: CSET reports 58% of in-demand skills for growing jobs are non-technical: process mapping, communication, judgment. That’s you.

**Bottom Line**: Your job isn’t disappearing. It’s shifting. Companies need professionals to manage AI-enhanced systems, coordinate projects, and bridge the gap between tech and business.
