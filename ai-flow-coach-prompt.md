# ⚙️ AI Flow Coach – Debugging Personal Development Overwhelm

> I’m feeling pulled between a lot of things right now — coding assignments, learning how AI works, trying to understand tools like GitHub Copilot, and thinking about how to eventually land a job in tech.

Can you act as an AI Career Flow Coach and give me a **simple but effective weekly routine** that balances the following:

- 📘 Staying on top of my **Cloud App Development coursework**
- 🧠 Exploring AI just enough to feel confident, not overwhelmed
- 🛠️ Building **one small project** to grow my skills
- 💼 Doing at least **one thing per week** to prep for the job market (resumes, mock interviews, GitHub, etc.)

Please:
- Be clear and realistic.
- Start me as if I haven’t built anything yet — no assumptions.
- Make it feel like I’m making smart progress without burnout.
- Include motivational nudges, reminders, and optional weekend resets.

I want structure, not stress. Coach me like a mentor who knows how to keep momentum going in a busy transition season.
