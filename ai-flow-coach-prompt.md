# ⚙️ AI Flow Coach – Debugging Personal Development Overwhelm

> I’m feeling pulled between coding, learning AI, understanding tools like GitHub Copilot, and prepping for the job market.

Can you act as an AI Career Flow Coach and give me a smart weekly routine that balances:
- Cloud App Dev coursework
- Light AI exploration
- Building a small project
- Prepping for interviews

I want structure without burning out or losing momentum.
