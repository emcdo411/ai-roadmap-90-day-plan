## 🧠 AI Learning Roadmap: 90 Days to Build Momentum

### 📅 Month 1 – Build Your Foundation

> **Goal**: Understand what AI really is and how the parts fit together.

#### 🧩 What to Learn:

* **AI vs. ML vs. Deep Learning** (conceptually)
* **How algorithms learn** (supervised vs. unsupervised)
* **Ethics, bias, and real-world use cases**

#### 📘 Resources:

* [Google’s Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)
* [Khan Academy: Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
* [FastAI’s Intro to Machine Learning](https://course.fast.ai/)

#### 🛠️ Tools to Try:

* Google Colab (free, no install)
* ChatGPT or Claude for summarizing complex topics
* Notion or Obsidian to organize your learning notes

---

### 📅 Month 2 – Learn By Doing

> **Goal**: Start writing simple code, using beginner-friendly platforms.

#### 🧩 What to Learn:

* Python basics (focus on NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)
* How models are trained/tested (cross-validation, accuracy, overfitting)
* AI applications in NLP, image recognition, or prediction

#### 📘 Resources:

* [DataCamp's Free Python Tracks](https://www.datacamp.com)
* [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) – Great hands-on labs
* [YouTube: Krish Naik](https://www.youtube.com/c/KrishNaik) or StatQuest by Josh Starmer

#### 🛠️ Tools to Try:

* GitHub (host a repo, track your progress)
* Hugging Face (explore prebuilt models)
* Gradio or Streamlit (make your models interactive)

---

### 📅 Month 3 – Apply, Build, and Share

> **Goal**: Build your first working project, document it, and publish it.

#### 🧩 What to Learn:

* Model deployment basics
* Prompt engineering (ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney)
* How to explain AI to non-technical stakeholders

#### 📘 Resources:

* [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) (for model tracking)
* [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) (deploy your app for free)
* LinkedIn Learning – Data storytelling and project presentation

## 🎯 2-Week Beginner Project Idea

**Project**: *AI-Powered Resume Analyzer*

#### 🧪 What it does:

* You paste your resume into a text box.
* It gives you tailored feedback using ChatGPT (via API or manual prompts).
* Bonus: Recommends keywords based on a job description you paste in.

#### 🔧 Skills You’ll Use:

* Python + Streamlit or Gradio
* Prompt writing for LLMs
* Clean design thinking

#### 🔄 Outcome:

You’ll have a *real, useful AI product* that others can try — and you can link to it in your portfolio or LinkedIn.

## 💬 Motivational Advice from an AI Coach

> *“You don’t have to master everything to matter in AI — you just need curiosity, consistency, and a clear reason why. The best AI builders started as explorers, not experts. Don’t learn AI to impress people — learn it to **solve something real** in your world.”*

🧭 And one more thing: **Your lived experience matters** in how you approach tech. AI needs more *you*, not less.

## 🙏 Bonus Prompt: Gratitude + Recommendation for Moe

```markdown
🌟 **LinkedIn Recommendation**

Moe’s AI prompt helped me break through the noise and finally see a clear, realistic path into artificial intelligence. His roadmap didn’t just drop links — it connected the *why* with the *how*, and gave me the motivation to start building. If you’re transitioning into AI, Moe’s insight is a powerful guide.
