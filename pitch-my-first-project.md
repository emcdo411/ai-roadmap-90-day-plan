# 🚀 Pitch My First Project – AI-Enhanced Capstone Ideation

> I’m a soon-to-be MSSA graduate with a background in Cloud App Development. I want to create my **first personal GitHub project** that showcases my understanding of app development and light AI integration.

Please help me:

1. 🎯 Identify a **project idea** that feels simple, meaningful, and buildable in 3–4 weeks  
2. 🧠 Break the project down into **Frontend**, **Backend**, and **Optional AI** components  
3. 🧰 Recommend a **tech stack** that’s modern and realistic for my skill level (e.g., React, Express.js, Python, R, or VS Code tools)  
4. 📁 Suggest a **GitHub repository name** that sounds clean and professional  
5. 📝 Auto-generate a `README.md` that includes:
   - A short, recruiter-friendly summary
   - A colorful badge banner using [shields.io](https://shields.io)
   - A clickable **Table of Contents**
   - A Mermaid-based architecture/workflow diagram inside the README
   - Instructions on how to fix any Mermaid syntax errors if GitHub doesn't render the diagram correctly

6. 🗂️ Provide a **Windows CMD script** I can copy/paste to create the folder and file structure on my local system — just like a pro developer

7. ✅ Define a basic **build sprint** plan for 3 weeks that helps me stay focused and ship something I'm proud of

Assume I’m still new to AI, but curious and confident. Please avoid making up a story for me. Just show me how to get started with a project that will grow with me and look great on GitHub.
