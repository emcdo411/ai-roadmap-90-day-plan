# ðŸš€ Pitch My First Project â€“ AI-Enhanced Capstone Ideation

> As a soon-to-be MSSA graduate, Iâ€™d like to build my first showcase project. Can you guide me to:

- Identify a simple app idea that blends my developer training with AI
- Break it into frontend, backend, and optional AI components
- Suggest what tech stack I should use (e.g., React, Express, Python, R)
- Outline a 3-week build sprint

Bonus: help me write a README that explains the project to recruiters.
