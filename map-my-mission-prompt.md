# ðŸ§­ Map My Mission â€“ AI Career Discovery Diagnostic

> Iâ€™m about to transition from military life into the civilian tech world through MSSA. Based on my current Cloud App Dev training, my interest in building tools, and limited exposure to AI, help me map out which direction I should explore:

- Junior Developer (Full Stack / Frontend / Backend)?
- DevOps or Cloud Engineer?
- AI Prompt Engineer or AI Tool Integrator?

What roles blend well with my military discipline and current tech stack? Suggest a few career trajectories with a 90-day action plan for each.
