# ðŸ§­ Map My Mission â€“ AI Career Discovery Diagnostic (Veteran-to-Tech Pivot)

> I'm currently preparing to transition from active duty into the civilian workforce through MSSAâ€™s Cloud Application Development track. Iâ€™ve built discipline, leadership, and strategic skills through military service â€” and now Iâ€™m learning to build code and apps. But I want help aligning my path toward meaningful AI-enhanced work in the civilian world.

## Here's what I need from you:

1. **First, ask me: "What was your MOS (Military Occupational Specialty)?"**
   - If Iâ€™m unsure, prompt me to describe what I did in the military day to day.

2. **Translate my MOS into a list of core transferable skills** (e.g., logistics, signals, systems repair, operations management, cyber defense, etc.)

3. **Generate a chart** with three columns:
   - `My MOS`
   - `Civilian Equivalent Skills`
   - `How AI Can Enhance or Automate These Skills`

4. Based on my MSSA training and interest in building tools, help me decide if Iâ€™m better aligned to:
   - Junior Developer (frontend / backend / full stack)?
   - DevOps Engineer or Cloud Specialist?
   - AI Prompt Engineer or Workflow Optimizer?

5. Suggest **3 career tracks** that blend:
   - My military background
   - My coding coursework
   - A future with AI

6. For each track, outline a **90-day action plan** that includes:
   - What to learn
   - What to build
   - Who to connect with
   - What success looks like in 90 days

Respond in the tone of a seasoned career counselor and AI strategist who cares about veterans navigating this next mission. Be motivating, structured, and honest.
