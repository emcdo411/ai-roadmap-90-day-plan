## 1. What This Is (and Isn’t)

✅ **This Is:**

* A live, practical intro to AI and prompting
* Focused on real work tasks, not hype
* Tailored for ERP/support/ops professionals

🚫 **This Is Not:**

* A deep-dive programming or art session
* A course for people who already use AI daily

---

## 2. What AI Is — and Why It Matters Now

* AI = machines that simulate human intelligence
* ChatGPT and Grok are **AI agents** you can chat with
* These tools can analyze, summarize, write, and automate
* Your job isn't going away — but **how it's done is changing**

---

## 3. AI Agents Overview: ChatGPT & Grok

🔹 **ChatGPT** (OpenAI): Best for structured tasks, research, explaining things simply
🔹 **Grok** (xAI/Twitter): Edgier, real-time knowledge, conversational tone

💡Use cases:

* Draft emails, summarize meetings, prep training docs
* Break down technical tasks into plain English

---

## 4. How to Talk to AI: Beginner Prompting

🗣️ Think of prompting like talking to a super assistant. Be clear, specific, and goal-focused.

**Prompt Tips:**

* 🎯 Give context: "I work in ERP support..."
* 🪄 Use plain English: "Help me create a checklist..."
* 🧭 Add a goal: "...for automating this report."

**Starter Prompts:**

```markdown
"Explain what AI is in 3 sentences for someone in tech support."

"List 3 ways I could use AI to reduce repetitive tasks in an ERP system."

"Write a draft message for my manager summarizing what I learned about AI today."
```

---

## 5. Work-Related Use Cases

🔧 **Examples of How AI Can Help at Work:**

* Auto-generate user guides based on tickets
* Draft SOPs from tribal knowledge
* Summarize 10 support tickets into 1 actionable doc
* Help troubleshoot issues faster by explaining logs/code

💼 **Bonus Idea:** AI can act as a test case writer or SQL explainer

---

## 6. Terms to Learn in the First 30 Days

* **Prompt engineering** – how you talk to AI
* **LLM (Large Language Model)** – the tech behind ChatGPT
* **Token** – a piece of text, used for billing/limits
* **Model version** – e.g., GPT-4 is smarter than GPT-3.5
* **Context window** – how much info AI can remember per chat
* **Training cut-off** – the most recent info AI knows
