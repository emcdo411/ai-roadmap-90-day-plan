# 🧭 AI Reset Starter Repo

## 🧠 What This Is
A **starter coaching toolkit** for folks who’ve spent years in ERP, support, implementation, or non-coding tech roles — and are now realizing AI is changing the landscape. This is NOT a prompt library. It’s a gentle but clear **pathway to help you learn what actually matters** in the next 30–120 days.

Whether you're laid off, anxious about your role becoming obsolete, or just confused about where to begin — this repo is designed to be your first step.
